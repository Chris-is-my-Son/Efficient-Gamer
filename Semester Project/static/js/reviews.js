    "The gameplay can be very relaxing depending what difficulty you are playing on. The difficulties are Peaceful, Easy, Normal, & Hard.\
    Peaceful gives you a calm environment without the worry of enemies coming to attack you.\
    The other difficulties include monsters ranging from large spiders to dragons that become harder to deal with as you go up in difficulty.\
    The game allows you to collect resources and build anything you want as long as you can thing of it.\
    It can be played through multiple times and many different ways with its randomly generated worlds.\
    Lastly, after you finish the game, you can switch it up and play any of the other game modes like Creative, Hardcore, and Adventure.\
    Creative allows you to build whatever you want whenever you want.\
    In Hardcore mode, the world is locked to Hard difficulty and the player cannot respawn after dying.\
    In Adventure mode the player cannot directly destroy any blocks with any tools or place any blocks, in order to avoid spoiling adventure maps or ruining other servers.\
    Minecraft never loses its playability. Meaning you can play it for a while, leave it for months, and come back to a game the will always be 'new'. Plus, it is constantly being updated.",

    "If you're looking for a mechanically fast paced game that requires quick thinking, then Starcraft may be for you.\
    Starcraft is a top down RTS game on PC. That means that it happens in real time. You can control 3 different races; Zerg (Aliens), Terran (Humans), and Protoss (Alien Robots).\
    You choose a race and battle it out against AI or another online player. You can upgrade your units to makes them stronger and even plan strategic ways to attack your opponent.\
    The game rewards fast thinking and even faster precision with your mouse. The storytelling of the game is really well done.\
    This game took aspects of the first Starcraft and made it even better.",

    "League of Legends is a real time MOBA game for PC. You can compete against other players in the world.\
    This game is also fast paced and requires strong hand-eye coordination as well as predictive offensive or defensive decisions.\
    The set up for this game is 5 players versus 5 players who each get to pick their own unique champions.\
    With over 160 champions, and counting, to choose from, this game adds plenty of variety each and every game.\
    As you play through a game, your champion gets experience through a basic leveling system of just being around these little creatures called 'minions' as they die, but to earn gold you must deal the killing blow.\
    As you level up, you can make your abilities stronger by using your experience points to level them up.\
    As you earn gold, you can use it to purchase items in the shop to make your champion stronger and deal more damage, take more damage, or even heal more depending on what champion you choose.\
    This game overall provides a sense of accomplishment with each win and a desire to do better with each lose.\
    It also is incredibly fun playing with friends to just mess around and play casually instead of competitively.\
    The biggest set back with this game is the community.\
    It can be extremely toxic or negative sometimes, so I recommend playing with friends or simply muting everyone when you jump into a game.",

    "This game is a mix of survival, sandbox, and horror all mixed together.\
    You are a one of two survivors of a plane crash looking for your son (the second survivor).\
    The plane crashes in (bingo you guessed it) a forest.\
    As you search the forest for remnants of your son you can chop down trees, pick bushes for berries, build campfires and log cabins, loot a yacht close to the shore, and fend off a group a hungry cannibals.\
    The game has weather bioms for different parts of the island/forest you're stranded on and some pretty intense cave systems.\
    The AI for the cannibals is decent to the point that when you have to fight them, it can be challenging.\
    The way you chop down trees or do anything for that matter can be a bit silly, but overall the game is well made.\
    The story has slowly progressed into something well made with each new update the developers make to the game.\
    Overall this game has great replay ability because you always have a new experience every time you play it.",

    "Terraria is a fun 2D action/adventure type sandbox game that features many different NPCs you can find, many different in-game events, a plethora of 'mobs' to fight, and a number of bosses to fight.\
    The world(s) of Terraria can be small, medium, or large and can spawn with one of two 'evil' biomes.\
    There are many places to explore where you might find chests with loot, and you can even mine ore and kill mobs to craft even more loot.\
    The bosses are somewhat tough while being satisfying to kill.\
    The end game goal is to defeat the final boss of the game, but there is so much to be discovered before doing so.\
    That being said, each boss may be fought as much as desired with the proper crafting materials.\
    Like a true sandbox game, you can play on the easiest or hardest of difficulties and there is significant replay ability.\
    The best part of Terraria is that you can play alone or online with friends.",

    "Age of Empires is also a PC game similar to Starcraft in gameplay except that it provides many more races to play as.\
    If you've ever wondered what it's like to have the vikings attack the roman empire, then look no further.\
    This game provides a massive variety when it comes to altering or upgrading units. You can command a vast amount of units and feel like you have so much control.\
    For anyone who played the original, this game definitely meets up to standards.",

    "Heroes of the Storm (HOTS) is a MOBA game made by Blizzard Entertainment that takes many Heroes and Villains from their other games, such as Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo with a few more.\
    It is a game with many different 'battlegrounds' to play on and is a team-oriented five versus five game in which the team shares experience, so they level up together.\
    Each character is controlled by a player, and they have unique talents that range from ability upgrades to passive upgrades to pick from as they level up.\
    There are different classes each hero belongs to that designate what their main focus is.\
    There are ranged assassins, melee assassins, tanks, bruisers, healers, and supports.\
    Each battleground has different objectives that each team will likely fight over to increase their odds of winning the game.\
    A game is won or lost when your or the opposing team's 'Core' has been destroyed, but the teams must destroy a number of secondary and tertiary structures before then.",

    "The Last Stand: Aftermath is a fun single-player rogue-like survival game in a zombie apocalypse setting.\
    For every playthrough, you select one of three different survivors to play as, each with a different loadout.\
    These survivors differ from the rest of your colony because they aren't immune to the infection like the rest of the colony.\
    Each 'run' is a race against the ever-growing infection while you look for supplies and knowledge to benefit your current and future runs.\
    The infection is interesting, in that you mutate at certain points in the infection while also slowly losing maximum health points.\
    Although you have anti-viral shots that can be found or crafted that briefly stop the spread of the infection, you can only hold one at a time.\
    The knowledge acts as a way to level up different attributes and skills while also being a currency for supply drops, weapon drops, starting supplies, and weapons that benefit current and future runs and a currency for the current run merchant.\
    The further you reach in each run, the more difficult enemies you discover.\
    Each run, you have a map that is traveled by vehicle and is generated new each run, aside from the starting and ending places.\
    My only complaint is that sometimes you can get stuck on the lower ground in certain areas and not get back up, having to start over in the current area you are visiting.\
    So if you found good loot that you liked, it will be gone; Although, there were a few times where the loot was the same as before reloading the area.\
    Overall, this game has excellent replay ability as you slowly unlock more and more items and skills."

    "Visually, Minecraft is just a bunch of blocks. Not a whole lot going on there...<br>\
    However, the ambient sounds provide mostly soothing feeling unless you're in the middle of battling a monster.\
    The music is really well done and incredibly relaxing for you when you are playing in any mode.",

    "The graphics aren't too fantastic, but they aren't anything to laugh about either. The maps and character models are made well and sometimes even convey compelling emotions.\
    The sound track is dynamic because it changes depending what race you play. It gives you a really nice futuristic, space feel while being just subtle enough for you to not be distracted in game.",

    "The artistic design for this game is purely amazing! The VFX artists do a terrific job on characters that are typically so small and hard to see anyway.\
    They have beautifully designed effects that happen with every single ability that every champion has.\
    161 champions times 4 abilities each equals to 644 individual graphics to design (not including custom skins they release for every champion).\
    When it comes to sounds, they have pretty nice ambient sounds and effects for all the champion abilities.\
    What they really do well are soundtracks for champions and events whenever they have them.\
    Champion specific sounds and music show just how dynamic they can be when creating anything for the game.",

    "Graphically it's a pretty intense game. The trees, logs, animals, plants, water, rock formations, and humans look really nice.\
    There is some gore in it, so being 18+ is recommended as well.\
    To a snob like me they aren't completely realistic, but the game does require a good graphics card to play it.\
    As for the sounds there isn't much music, but the atmospheric noises and rustling of bushes definitely can put some fear into your heart when you can't tell if a cannibal is after you or just a bunny.",

    "Terraria has one of the best original soundtracks I have ever heard in my many years of gaming.\
    Each biome, boss, and event have its own theme with some even having their own weather and daytime/nighttime cycle variant as well.\
    The visuals are appealing yet simple as the graphics are 32 bit which gives it an almost classic feel.\
    The color schemes for the biomes make each one very distinguishable and recognizable from the others.",

    "The graphics here are little better when it comes to realism, but the graphics aren't anything to praise either.\
    The soundtrack on the other hand is incredible. It provides so much atmosphere with the ambient sounds and dynamically changing music.\
    It really makes you feel like you are in the era of whatever race you may be playing.",

    "Heroes of the Storm has a recognizable soundtrack that contains tracks from Blizzard Entertainment's other games, but also has some original pieces for their battlegrounds as well.\
    Visually Heroes is very well done with excellent graphics and each battleground has its own unique flair with makes them easily distinguishable.",

    "The visuals and audio in the game reflect the premise very well.\
    Every aspect looks and sounds like you would expect a zombie apocalypse to be.\
    You have broken down abandoned houses and cars, abandoned military bases, and abandoned survivor compounds.\
    Each environmental setting can be visited during the daytime or nighttime depending on the progress in your run.\
    You hear the rumbling and growls of the zombies in the surrounding areas as well as the atmosphere that\
    would relate to where you are i.e. birds, leaves in the wind, and flowing creeks if you are in the woods."
